# Machine-Learning-Projects
Repository for some of Machine Learning Projects I worked on. Here are the general steps I follow for building models.. 
- Analyze and visualize complex datasets using advanced python & Machine Learning libraries
- Develope intricate Machine Learning algorithms for both supervised and unsupervised learning based on exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Create Machine learning models using Regression, Classification, Clustering, Deep learning Statistical techniques
- Calculate different metrics to make sure created model is not over-fitting or under-fitting 
- Finally identify the inputs that has most significance for the model
