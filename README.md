# Machine-Learning-Projects
![](zmg/ml1.jpg)

Repository for some of Machine Learning Projects I worked on. Here are the general steps I follow for building models.. 
- Analyze and visualize complex datasets using advanced python & Machine Learning libraries.
- Develop intricate machine learning algorithms based on exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- Create machine learning models using Regression, Classification, Clustering, Deep learning Statistical techniques.
- Calculate different metrics to make sure created model is not over-fitting or under-fitting.
- Finally identify the inputs that has most significance for the model.
